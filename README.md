# Emb(race): Additional ideas

Technology has the power to drive action. And right now, a call to action is needed to eradicate racism. **Black lives matter.**

We recognize technology alone cannot fix hundreds of years of racial injustice and inequality, but when we put it in the hands of the Black community and their supporters, technology can begin to bridge a gap. To start a dialogue. To identify areas where technology can help pave a road to progress.

This project comlplements three open source projects underway as part of the [Call for Code Emb(race) Spot Challenge](https://github.com/topics/embrace-call-for-code) led by contributors from IBM and Red Hat.

This repository is intended to capture additional ideas that are not part of the three focus areas.

## Goal for this project

The desired outcome of this effort is an open source technology solution that 
can have a measurable impact on the problem statements and hills below. That 
solution can then be put to work within IBM and Red Hat, as well as society at 
large.

As an example, this repository will evolve into a piece of technology that can
be created and deployed, similar to the steps for other [Call for Code starter
kits](https://github.com/Call-for-Code).

## Contribute to this effort

1. **Engage**
   * Understand the [problem statements](#problem-statements) in this solution starter GitHub repository.   
   * Connect with colleagues in [Slack](SLACK.md) to join one of the teams working on solutions to this problem.

2. **Envision**
   * Imagine the measurable end result of a technology innovation for one of the problem statements.
   * Plot a path from the current situation to that outcome. You can use [Mural](https://www.mural.co/) and [Slack](SLACK.md) to collaborate.

3. **Contribute**
   * IBMers: [Learn](https://w3.ibm.com/developer/opensource/learn/certify/) about open source and [certify](https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/EL01-00001160) before contributing.
